# **App Name**: ResistorCalc Pro

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Resistor Visualization: Interactive resistor image that updates in real-time to reflect selected color codes.
- Value Input Fields: Input fields for entering resistor values (numerical input validation required).
- Color Code Selection: Color code selectors to specify band colors (support for 4, 5, and 6 band resistors).
- Real-Time Resistance Calculation: Real-time calculation of resistance based on input values and color codes.
- Calculation Display: Display the calculated resistance, tolerance, and temperature coefficient.
- Band Configuration Options: Ability to switch between different resistor band configurations (4, 5, 6 bands).
- AI Guided Value Modification: Generate a recommendation if user's value is too extreme to exist in any common resistor value using AI as a tool. Give recommendations as to which band should be modified and by how much.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark forest green (#228B22) for a professional and grounded feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5DC) for a clean and subtle contrast.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) for highlighting important information and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for a sleek, technical look.
- Animated icons for interactive elements like the resistor bands and input fields, enhancing user experience.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the calculation process.
- Subtle animations when updating the resistor image and displaying calculated values to provide visual feedback.
